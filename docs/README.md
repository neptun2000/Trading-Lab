# How to Read This Repository

If you are new here, check out the main `README.md` and **do not start by reading the code**.
Start with the documents below.

This folder is best read in the recommended order rather than file-by-file.

---

## Recommended Reading Order

### 1. Design Intent (Optional)
These documents explain *why* the system looks and operates the way it does.

- [design-principles.md](design-principles.md) — Core philosophy and tradeoffs

---

### 2. How a Run Works
Main ideas and caveats for execution.

- [important-constraints.md](important-constraints.md) — Current design boundaries
- [workflow.md](workflow.md) — End-to-end lifecycle of a single run

---

### 3. What the System Can Do
These describe the major capabilities at a high level.

- `capabilities/`
  - [accessing-state.md](capabilities/accessing-state.md)
  - [file-interaction.md](capabilities/file-interaction.md)
  - [metrics.md](capabilities/metrics.md)
  - [graphing.md](capabilities/graphing.md)
  - [creating-and-parsing-prompts.md](creating-and-parsing-prompts.md)

---

### 4. Reading the Code
Once the above is clear, start here:

- `user_side/*` — Example user-facing workflow
- `libb/model.py` — Central orchestrator (`LIBBModel`)
- `libb/execution/` — Order processing and portfolio mutation
- `libb/metrics/` — Metrics and analysis modules
